# Challenge procedure:
#   1. The challenge will be hosted for students of our college and they will be given 4 problems to work on. 
#   2. Participants will upload separate python scripts for each problem to EvalAI and the evaluation script has to run the submission script on 
#   the data and compute output metric to be shown in the public leaderboard.
#   3. A single Leaderboard has to display Name, Branch, Year, Score of Q1, Score of Q2, Score of Q3, Score of Q4 and the Total cumulative scores from 
#   the three questions.
